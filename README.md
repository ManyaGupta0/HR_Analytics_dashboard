# 💼 HR Analytics Dashboard (Excel Project)

A visually interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze employee attrition and uncover key HR insights — built as part of my journey into HR Analytics and Excel data visualization.

## 📊 Project Overview

This Excel-based dashboard explores attrition patterns across multiple HR dimensions using PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and logical formulas. The goal: turn raw HR data into actionable insights that help HR teams retain top talent and improve decision-making.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Attrition Breakdown** by:
  - Salary Band (Low / Medium / High)

- **Interactive Slicers**: Filter the dashboard by Department, Job Role, and Gender

## 💡 Insights Discovered

- 📉 **High attrition among top earners** — retention issues may lie beyond compensation
- 🧑‍🔬 **R&D and Sales departments** have the highest attrition — possible signs of burnout or misalignment
- 👶 **Young professionals (25–34)** and **early-tenure employees** are leaving more frequently — onboarding and engagement need attention
- 📈 **Promotion timing** does not directly reduce attrition — other engagement drivers are needed
